# Servers Scripts

This directory contains scripts used to start servers using the `steamcmd`
container. When used a given script must be renamed to `server.sh` to allow
the container to use it as entrypoint.

These scripts are only examples to help you design yours. They are still
usable without any changes if you just want to start servers without anything
fancy.
